## Variables and Lifetimes

## Content
- Variables and lifetimes.

## Informations
- In general, the scope is defined as the extent up to which something can be worked with. In programming also the scope of a variable is defined as the extent of the program code within which the variable can be accessed or declared or worked with. There are mainly two types of variable scopes: 

    - Local Variables
    - Global Variables

- Local Variables
    - Variables defined within a function or block are said to be local to those functions.  

    - Anything between ‘{‘ and ‘}’ is said to inside a block.
    - Local variables do not exist outside the block in which they are declared, i.e. they can not be accessed or used outside that block.
    - Declaring local variables: Local variables are declared inside a block.

- Global Variables
    - they are available through out the life time of a program.
    - They are declared at the top of the program outside all of the functions or blocks.
    - Declaring global variables: Global variables are usually declared outside of all of the functions and blocks, at the top of the program. They can be accessed from any portion of the program.
