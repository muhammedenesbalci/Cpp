**Informations**

- ***String*** is a sequence of characters represented as a data type. It is used to store and manipulate text or character data. The C++ Standard Library provides the ***std::string*** class to work with strings. To use strings in C++, you need to include the `<string>` header file.
- ***Cstring*** refers to the C-style string library, which is part of the C Standard Library. It provides a set of functions for working with null-terminated character arrays, commonly known as C-strings. C-strings are character arrays that represent strings in C++. They are sequences of characters terminated by a null character (`'\0'`). C-strings are typically declared as character arrays, and individual characters can be accessed using array indexing.
